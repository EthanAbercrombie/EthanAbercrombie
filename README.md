I am a PhD student at Washington University. I study the effects of climate change on plant and animal communities in montane environments. 

I love what I do, and am fortunate to work in environments and with data from places like Costa Rica, the Sierra Nevada's (California) and at the Tyson Research Center (Missouri).
